		<h2 id="few_shot_maml">Few-shot learning with MAML</h2>
		<p>Model-Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) is a meta-learning approach to solve few-shot learning <d-cite
				bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>.
			To learn more about it, let us build an example from the ground up and then try to apply MAML.
			We will do this by alternating mathematical walk-throughs and interactive, as well as, coding examples.
		</p>
		<!--TODO: Maybe card to github repo for all code: https://github.com/lepture/github-cards-->
		<p>
			If you have applied machine learning
			before, you have probably already solved or attempted to solve a problem like the following:
			Learning a model to solve one specific task, for example to classify cats from dogs or to
			teach an agent
			to find its way through a specific maze. In those settings, if we are able to define a loss
			\(\mathcal{L}_\tau\) for our task \(\tau\) which depends on the parameters
			\(\phi\) of a model, we can express our learning objective as

			\[ \underset{\phi}{\text{min}} \, \mathcal{L}_\tau (\phi) .\]

			We usually find the optimal \(\phi\) by progressively walking along the direction of the gradient of
			\(\mathcal{L}_\tau\) with respect to \(\phi\), i.e.

			\[ \phi \leftarrow \phi - \alpha \nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}_\tau (\phi) ,\]

			also known as gradient descent, where \(\mathcal{L}_\tau\) usually also depends on some data and \(\alpha\)
			is a fixed learning rate,
			controlling the size of the steps we want to take.
		</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, when framing this in a few-shot setting (i.e., with a very small dataset), the above method is
			known to perform poorly on e.g. neural networks, since there is simply too little data for too many
			parameters. A key insight to MAML is now to
			bypass this problem by learning not only from the data regarding exactly our task, but to learn also from
			data of similar tasks.
			To incorporate this we make an additional assumption, namely that \(\tau\) comes from some distribution of
			tasks \(p(\tau)\) and that we
			can sample freely from this distribution. We can then generalize the above objective to learn how to find an
			optimization strategy for a randomly sampled task from \(p(\tau)\), which we can express as follows:

			\[ \text{min} \, \mathbb{E}_\tau [ \mathcal{L}_\tau (\phi_\tau) ] ,\]

			where \(\tau\) is now a random variable and \(\phi_\tau\) are a set of parameters for task \(\tau\).
			We may use different parameters for each task, use the same parameters for every task or something in
			between. So we have to decide on a parameterization and decide how we actually minimize this new objective.
			In the following we will explore two possible
			answers to these issues.
		</p>
		<h3>Part 1: Just do gradient descent, silly!</h3>
		<p>Of course! The answer to most problems. We can simply learn a single set of parameters \(\phi\) which
			minimizes the expected loss
			over all tasks. Or formally speaking our objective becomes

			\[ \underset{\phi}{\text{min}} \, \mathbb{E}_\tau [ \mathcal{L}_\tau (\phi) ] .\]

			As you can see we chose the most simple parameterization: We learn one parameter vector \(\phi\) that
			minimizes the objective
			across all tasks.
			Further, to actually implement this strategy we can do what is known as <i>Expected Risk Minimization
				(ERM)</i>, which tells us to sample a lot of tasks \(\tau\) and then descent according to

			\[ \phi \leftarrow \phi - \alpha \nabla_\phi \sum_i \mathcal{L}_{\tau_i} (\phi) .\]

			Finn et al. (the authors of MAML) call this type of model <i>pretrained</i>, referring to it simply
			pretraining over all available data and
			then trying to converge on a small amount of samples later.
		</p>
		<h4>Implementing the Pretrained Model</h4>
		<p>
			If the above has gotten all too theoretic for you, take a look at the following <i>gist</i>. It contains a
			simplistic
			implementation of an update step for this <i>pretrained</i> model. It is implemented such as to emphesize
			that
			even if we differentiate between tasks when sampling the batch, the actual optimizer treats each sample the
			same.
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/pupuis/cf31417164bc5513302788b906d2a3c2.js"></script>
		<p>
			The implementation is agnostic to the choice of optimizer that you use. To train their <i>pretrained</i>
			model, the MAML creators use
			the <i>Adam</i> optimizer.
		</p>
		<h4>Pretrained Model on a Sinusoid Problem</h4>
		<p>
			In the following figure you can experiment with a <i>pretrained</i> model, which was trained by a collection
			of
			sinusoid regression tasks. The task distribution works as follows: Each task is represented by an amplitude
			\(A\) and a
			phase \(\varphi\) and requires the prediction of sinusoid \(f\):

			\[ f(x) := A \sin(x + \varphi),\]

			where \(A, \varphi\) are sampled uniformly from some predefined range.

			The jist is that different parameters yield different functions \(f_1\) and \(f_2\) with possibly completely
			different function values and gradients.
			Take for example the following two tasks:
			Tasks \(\tau_1, \tau_2\) are both regression tasks on sinusoids \(f_1(x) := \sin (x - \frac{\pi}{2})\) and
			\(f_2(x) := \sin (x + \frac{\pi}{2})\) respectively. These two tasks' function values give completely
			contradicting information, as

			\[ f_1(x) = - f_2(x). \]
		</p>
		<p>
			Before you fit the model, think what
			you would expect to happen based on the position and the
			amount of samples you provided. Feel free to also experiment with the different settings: Distributing the
			samples equispaced or squeezing all of them to a small range
			of the x-axis.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<d-figure id="fitSinePretrained"></d-figure>
		</figure>
		<p>Ouch! That doesn't seem to work that well. Maybe you have already guessed that this would have been to easy.
			The problem that the above approach faces is that the optimal parameters of
			different tasks might live in completely different loss spaces. Given a loss function \(\mathcal{L}\) w.r.t
			some parameters \(\rho\), as well as
			constant parameter-set \(C\) (e.g. a dataset on which the loss is defined), the parameter space defined the
			function values of

			\[ \mathcal{L}(\rho; C) .\]

			You can investigate the problem of different loss spaces for different tasks a little deeper in
			<a href="#twoLossSpaces">this figure</a>. The loss spaces displayed stem from a curve fitting (toy) problem,
			where
			we are interested in parameters \(a, b\)
			and the task requires the prediction of

			\[g(x) = \xi(ax + b),\]

			where \(\xi\) is a non-linearity we applied to make the resulting loss spaces a bit more interesting. 
		</p>
		<figure>
			<d-figure id="twoLossSpaces"></d-figure>
		</figure>
		<p>
			At this point we can conclude that optimizating for parameter-vector \(\phi\) minimizing all task
			distributions at the same time
			is maybe not the best parameter to optimize for. The next approach rather optimizes another variable of the
			problem. Maybe you already have a hunch?
		</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Just do Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, silly!</h3>
		<p>
			MAML comes to our rescue. We have already seen how different tasks might give us contradicting function
			values at the same query point and how that leads to an undesired ping-pong from one local optimum to
			another, resulting in no meaningful convergence. The idea of MAML is now to
			learn an optimal initialization \(\theta\) in the sense that initializating a task optimizer with these
			parameters and taking gradient descent steps
			from there minimizes the loss for that task. We can express this formally as follows:

			\[ \underset{\theta}{\text{min}} \, \mathbb{E}_\tau [ \mathcal{L}_\tau (U_\tau(\theta)) ] .\]

			where \(U_\tau\) is an optimizer that takes a number of gradient descent steps given the samples of task
			\(\tau\). This is also why MAML is called mode-agnostic, it does
			not make any further assumptions about \(U_\tau\), thus allowing any gradient-based inner optimizer.
		</p>
		<h4>Outline of the Algorithm</h4>
		<p>
			Now that we fixed the objective function, let us briefly take a look at the three main steps of the method,
			given a (current)
			meta-parameter \(\theta\):
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Sample a number of tasks \(\tau_i\) from \(p(\tau)\).</li>
			<li>2. For each task obtain \(\phi_i = U_{\tau_i}(\theta)\), by minimizing \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i,
				\text{train}}(\theta)\)
				on a few training samples.</li>
			<li>3. Update \(\theta\) by gradient descent such that it minimizes \(\mathcal{L}(\theta) := \sum_i
				\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{test}}(\phi_i)\) on a few
				test samples.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note that \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{train}}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{test}}\) are two instances
			of the same loss function
			for different tasks and corresponding training or test data from these tasks.
			Obtaining the \(\phi_i\) is easy, we just do gradient descent:

			\[ \phi_i = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{train}}(\theta).\]

			Further, updating \(\theta\) requires us to evaluate the gradient of the individual task losses on a set of
			test data. We obtain
			the gradient of the overall loss as follows:

			\[ \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \sum_{i} \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{test}}(\phi_i)
			.\]

			Note that \(\phi_i = U_{\tau_i}(\theta)\) depends on \(\theta\), which means that we have to take a gradient
			through the optimizer
			\(U\). We can then update \(\theta\) via gradient descent, using a new learning rate \(\beta\):

			\[ \theta' = \theta - \beta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta).\]

			And that 🥁... is more or less everything that comprises the original MAML algorithm.
		</p>
		<h4>Implementing the Algorithm</h4>
		<p>
			However, a machine learning algorithm is not very usefull unless we can execute it on a computer. While
			implementing the <i>pretrained</i>
			model was more or less straightforward, implementing MAML requires some more thinking. Firstly, computing
			\(\phi_i\) is still straightforward, simply call
			the optimization algorithm of your choice (as long as it is gradient-based).
			However, how do we then take the gradient through that optimization algorithm?
			It's actually not that complicated. Almost every modern machine learning framework (e.g. tensorflow), can
			differentiate through
			nearly arbitrary python code. Hence, if we can express our optimizer in a python function, then tensorflow
			can differentiate through it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Below you find a <i>gist</i> that implements a simplistic version of the MAML update step. We coded our
			optimizer ourselves within the function
			<i>fastWeights</i>, but the function also directly applies an input tensor to the optimized weights. We did
			this mainly for simplicity but if you
			are interested in a more thorough reasoning about this design choice, you can read more about it <a
				href="https://gist.github.com/pupuis/f23f483c405b0a169bf279f7b02209bc">in the comments under the
				gist</a>.
		</p>

		<h4>Will it really work?</h4>
		<p>
			Before we study the MAML model on the sinusoid task distribution, let us spend some
			time on trying to understand MAML intuitively. Why would we expect it to produce better results than the
			pretrained model? To answer this, recall the exercise of <a href="#twoLossSpaces">comparing loss spaces</a>
			from before.
			As stated above, MAML tries to learn an optimal initialization \(\theta\), from which we can easily descent
			both \(\phi_i\) point to the minimum of their respective tasks. This is exactly what MAML does! And now you
			know first hand, why it might actually work.
		</p>
		<h4>Returning to Sinusoids</h4>
		<p>
			After having studied the math behind the MAML objective, as well as its intuition and implementation, it is
			time to evaluate it on the sinusoid example.
			Hopefully, MAML will produce better results
			than the pretrained model (although by now you should be convinced that it will).
			You will have the opportunity to repeat the above experiements on a model that has been trained with
			MAML in <a href="#fitSineMaml">this figure</a>.
			Try to compare the optimization behavior of both the pretrained model and MAML and evaluate for yourself
			whether
			you think the MAML-trained model has found a good meta-initialization parameter \(\theta\).
		</p>
		<figure>
			<d-figure id="fitSineMaml"></d-figure>
		</figure>
		<p>
			So as you were hopefully able to verify, MAML produces results that are way closer to the actual sinusoid,
			despite being exposed to at most 5 samples.
		</p>
		<p>
			The rest of this article is dedicated to introducing interesting extensions of MAML. The <a
				href="first-order.html">next page</a>
			starts with a general discussion about the difficulty of obtaining the MAML-meta-gradient, which leads
			directly to <a href="first-order.html#section_fomaml">FOMAML</a>, a simple
			first-order version of MAML. A slightly different first-order approach, but still in the spirit of MAML, is
			<a href="reptile.html">Reptile</a>,
			which obtains meta-knowledge without an explicit meta-gradient.

			Lastly, <a href="imaml.html">iMAML</a> approximates the meta-update by creating a dependency between task-loss and meta-parameter \(\theta\) and 
			thereby bypasses some of the computationally more expensive parts of the original MAML.
