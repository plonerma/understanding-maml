		<h2 id="few_shot_maml">How MAML works</h2>
		<p>Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is a meta-learning approach to solve different tasks from simple regression to reinforcement learning but also few-shot learning. <d-cite
				bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>.
			To learn more about it, let us build an example from the ground up and then try to apply MAML.
			We will do this by alternating mathematical walk-throughs and interactive, as well as coding examples.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have applied machine learning
			before, you have probably already solved or attempted to solve a problem like the following:
			Learning a model to solve one specific task, for example, to classify cats from dogs or to
			teach an agent
			to find its way through a specific maze. In these settings, if we are able to define a loss
			\(\mathcal{L}_\tau\) for our task \(\tau\), which depends on the parameters
			\(\phi\) of a model, we can express our learning objective as

			\[ \underset{\phi}{\text{min}} \, \mathcal{L}_\tau (\phi) .\]

			We usually find the optimal \(\phi\) by progressively walking along the direction of the gradient of
			\(\mathcal{L}_\tau\) with respect to \(\phi\), i.e.

			\[ \phi \leftarrow \phi - \alpha \nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}_\tau (\phi) ,\]

			also known as gradient descent. \(\mathcal{L}_\tau\) usually also depends on some data and \(\alpha\)
			is a fixed learning rate,
			controlling the size of the steps we want to take.
		</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, applying this to a regession or a few-shot setting (i.e., with a very small dataset), the above method is
			known to perform poorly on, e.g., neural networks, since there is simply too little data for too many
			parameters leading to overfitting.

            The key idea of MAML is to
			mitigate this problem by learning not only from the data regarding exactly our task but also from
			data of similar tasks.
			To incorporate this, we make an additional assumption, namely that \(\tau\) comes from some distribution of
			tasks \(p(\tau)\) and that we
			can sample freely from this distribution. We can then generalize the above
			objective to find an optimization strategy for a randomly sampled task
			from \(p(\tau)\), which we can express as follows:

			\[ \text{min} \, \mathbb{E}_\tau [ \mathcal{L}_\tau (\phi_\tau) ] ,\]

			where \(\tau\) is now a random variable and \(\phi_\tau\) is a set of
			parameters for task \(\tau\). We may use different parameters for each
			task, use the same parameters for every task, or do something in between.

			Next, we have figure out how to actually minimize this new objective including the decision of parameterization.
			In the following, we will explore two possible
			answers.
		</p>
		<h3>Part 1: Just do gradient descent, silly!</h3>
		<p>Of course, the answer to most problems. We can simply learn a single set of parameters \(\phi\), which
			minimizes the expected loss
			over all tasks. Formally speaking, our objective becomes

			\[ \underset{\phi}{\text{min}} \, \mathbb{E}_\tau [ \mathcal{L}_\tau (\phi) ] .\]

			As you can see, we chose the most simple parameterization: We learn one parameter vector \(\phi\) that
			minimizes the objective
			across all tasks.
			Further, to actually implement this strategy we can do what is known as <i>Expected Risk Minimization
				(ERM)</i>, which tells us to sample a lot of tasks \(\tau\) and then descent according to

			\[ \phi \leftarrow \phi - \alpha \nabla_\phi \sum_i \mathcal{L}_{\tau_i} (\phi) .\]

			Finn et al.<d-cite
				bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>, the authors of MAML, call this type of model <i>pretrained</i>:
    			we can simply pretrain over all available data and
    			then try to converge on a small amount of samples later.
    			<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>

		</p>
		<h4>Implementing the Pretrained Model</h4>
		<p>
			If the above has gotten all too theoretical for you, take a look at the following <i>gist</i>. It contains a
			simplistic
			implementation of an update step
            for this <i>pretrained</i> model. It is implemented to emphasize
			that
			even if we differentiate between tasks when sampling the batch, the actual optimizer treats each sample the
			same.
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/pupuis/cf31417164bc5513302788b906d2a3c2.js"></script>
		<p>
			The implementation is agnostic to the choice of optimizer. We use the <i>Adam</i> optimizer to be congruent with the original paper<d-cite
				bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>.
		</p>
		<h4>Pretrained Model on a Sinusoid Problem (Regression)</h4>
		<p>
			In the following figure, you can experiment with a <i>pretrained</i> model trained by a collection
			of sinusoid regression tasks.
            The task distribution works as follows: Each task is represented by an amplitude
			\(A\) and a
			phase \(\varphi\) and requires the prediction of sinusoid \(f\):

			\[ f(x) := A \sin(x + \varphi),\]

			where \(A, \varphi\) are sampled uniformly from some predefined range.

			Different parameters yield different functions, \(f_1\) and \(f_2\), with possibly completely
			different function values and gradients.
			Take, for example, the following two tasks:
			Tasks \(\tau_1, \tau_2\) are both regression tasks on sinusoids \(f_1(x) := \sin (x - \frac{\pi}{2})\) and
			\(f_2(x) := \sin (x + \frac{\pi}{2})\) respectively. These two tasks' function values give completely
			contradicting information, as

			\[ f_1(x) = - f_2(x). \]
		</p>
		<p>
			Before fitting the model, what do you expect to happen based on the position and the
			number of samples provided? Feel free to also experiment with the different settings: distributing the
			samples equispaced or squeezing all of them to a small range
			of the x-axis.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<d-figure id="fitSinePretrained"></d-figure>
		</figure>
		<p>Ouch! That does not seem to work that well. Maybe you have already guessed that this would have been too easy.
			The problem that the pretrained approach faces is that the optimal parameters of
			different tasks might live in completely different loss spaces. Given a loss function \(\mathcal{L}\) w.r.t
			some parameters \(\rho\), as well as
			constant parameter-set \(C\) (e.g. a dataset on which the loss is defined), the parameter space defined the
			function values of

			\[ \mathcal{L}(\rho; C) .\]

			You can investigate the problem of different loss spaces for different tasks a little deeper in the figure below. The loss spaces displayed stem from a curve fitting (toy) problem,
			where
			we are interested in parameters \(a, b\)
			and the task requires the prediction of

			\[g(x) = \xi(ax + b),\]

			where \(\xi\) is a non-linearity we applied to make the resulting loss spaces a bit more interesting.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<d-figure id="twoLossSpaces"></d-figure>
		</figure>
		<p>
			At this point, we can conclude that optimizing for parameter-vector \(\phi\) by minimizing all task
			distributions at the same time
			is maybe not the best parameter to optimize for. The following approach rather optimizes another variable of the
			problem. Maybe you already have a hunch?
		</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Just do model-agnostic meta-learning, silly!</h3>
		<p>
			MAML comes to our rescue. We have already seen how different tasks might give us contradicting function
			values at the same query point and how that leads to an undesired ping-pong from one local optimum to
			another, resulting in no meaningful convergence. The idea of MAML is to
			learn an optimal initialization \(\theta\).

			Initializing a task optimizer with these optimal parameters and taking gradient descent steps
			from there should minimize the loss for that task. We can express this formally as follows:

			\[ \underset{\theta}{\text{min}} \, \mathbb{E}_\tau [ \mathcal{L}_\tau (U_\tau(\theta)) ] ,\]

			where \(U_\tau\) is an optimizer that takes several gradient descent steps given the samples of task
			\(\tau\).
		</p>
		<h4>Outline of the Algorithm</h4>
		<p>
			After fixing the objective function, let us briefly take a look at the three main steps of the method,
			given a (current)
			meta-parameter \(\theta\) :
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Sample a number of tasks \(\tau_i\) from \(p(\tau)\).</li>
			<li>2. For each task obtain \(\phi_i = U_{\tau_i}(\theta)\), by minimizing \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i,
				\text{train}}(\theta)\)
				on a few training samples.</li>
			<li>3. Update \(\theta\) by gradient descent such that it minimizes \(\mathcal{L}(\theta) := \sum_i
				\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{test}}(\phi_i)\) on a few
				test samples.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note, that \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{train}}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{test}}\)
			are two instances of the same loss function
			on the same task \( \tau_i \) and corresponding training or test data from
			this task (though  \( \tau_i \) changes while iterating over \(i \) ).
			The easiest way to obtain \(\phi_i\), is to do a single step of gradient
			descent (\( \phi_i \) will not be optimal but most likely better then \( \theta \) ):

			\[ \phi_i = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{train}}(\theta).\]

			Further, updating \(\theta\) requires us to evaluate the gradient of the individual task losses on a set of
			test data. We obtain
			the gradient of the overall loss as follows:

			\[ \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \sum_{i} \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{test}}(\phi_i)
			.\]

			Note that \(\phi_i = U_{\tau_i}(\theta)\) depends on \(\theta\), which means that we have to take a gradient
			through the optimizer
			\(U\). We can then update \(\theta\) via gradient descent, using a new learning rate \(\beta\):

			\[ \theta' = \theta - \beta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta).\]

			And that ü•Å... is more or less everything that comprises the original MAML algorithm.
		</p>
		<h4>Implementing the Algorithm</h4>
		<p>
			However, a machine learning algorithm is not very useful unless we can execute it on a computer. While
			implementing the <i>pretrained</i>
			model was more or less straightforward, implementing MAML requires some more thinking. Firstly, computing
			\(\phi_i\) is still straightforward; simply call
			the optimization algorithm of your choice (as long as it is gradient-based).
			However, how do we then take the gradient through that optimization algorithm?
			It is actually not that complicated. Almost every modern machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow <d-cite
				bibtex-key="DBLP:journals/corr/AbadiABBCCCDDDG16"></d-cite> ), can
			differentiate through
			nearly arbitrary python code. Hence, if we can express our optimizer in a python function, TensorFlow
			can differentiate through it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Below you find a <i>gist</i> that implements a simplistic version of the MAML update step. The
			optimizer is encoded within the function
			<i>fastWeights</i>, but the function also directly applies an input tensor to the optimized weights.
			We did
			this mainly for simplicity, but if you
			are interested in a thorough reasoning about this design choice, you can read more about it <a
				href="https://gist.github.com/pupuis/f23f483c405b0a169bf279f7b02209bc">in the comments under the
				gist</a>.
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/pupuis/f23f483c405b0a169bf279f7b02209bc.js"></script>
		<h4>Will it really work?</h4>
		<p>
			Before we study the MAML model on the sinusoid task distribution, let us spend some
			time on trying to understand MAML intuitively. Why would we expect it to produce better results than the
			pretrained model? To answer this, recall the exercise of <a href="#twoLossSpaces">comparing loss spaces</a>
			from before.
			As stated above, MAML tries to learn an optimal initialization \(\theta\), from which we can easily descent
			both \(\phi_i\) point to the minimum of their respective tasks. This is exactly what MAML does. Now you
			know first hand why it might actually work.
		</p>
		<h4>Returning to Sinusoids</h4>
		<p>
			After studying the math behind the MAML objective, as well as its intuition and implementation, it is
			time to evaluate it on the sinusoid example.
			Hopefully, MAML will produce better results
			than the pretrained model.
			You will have the opportunity to repeat the above experiments on a model that has been trained with
			MAML in <a href="#fitSineMaml">this figure</a>.
			Try to compare the optimization behavior of both the pretrained model and MAML and evaluate for yourself
			whether
			you think the MAML-trained model has found a good meta-initialization parameter \(\theta\).
		</p>
		<figure>
			<d-figure id="fitSineMaml"></d-figure>
		</figure>
		<p>
			So as you were hopefully able to verify, MAML produces results that are way closer to the actual sinusoid,
			despite being exposed to at most five samples.
		</p>
		<p>
			The rest of this article is dedicated to introducing interesting variants of MAML. The <a
				href="first-order.html">next page</a>
			starts with a general discussion about the difficulty of obtaining the MAML-meta-gradient, which leads
			directly to <a href="first-order.html#section_fomaml">FOMAML</a>, a simple
			first-order version of MAML. A slightly different first-order approach, but still in the spirit of MAML, is
			<a href="reptile.html">Reptile</a>,
			which obtains meta-knowledge without an explicit meta-gradient.

			Lastly, <a href="imaml.html">iMAML</a> approximates the meta-update by creating a dependency between task-loss and meta-parameter \(\theta\) and
			thereby bypasses some of the computationally more expensive parts of the original MAML.
