		<h2>Comparing MAML, the First-Order Methods and iMAML</h2>
		<p>
			In order to compare the above methods visually, we return to the non-linearized-line-fitting problem from
			before, see <a href="#metaGradient">this figure</a>. This time, however, we will plot a single
			update direction of MAML, FOMAML, Reptile and iMAML on the <i>combined loss space</i> of the two tasks, such that you can verify
			whether the methods point into reasonable directions (i.e. towards
			to the local optimum).

			The combined loss space is defined via the meta loss of the two tasks, i.e.

			\[\mathcal{L}(\theta) := \sum_{i \in \{0, 1\}}
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{test}}(\phi_i).\]

			A word of warning: The update directions are computed on actual data and with the actual algorithms, running
			in your browser on <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">tensorflow.js</a>.
			If you are experiencing delays on the vector update when moving \(\theta\) you can disable some of the
			computations via
			the panel under the figure.

		<h3>Empirical comparison</h3>

		<p>
			By now you have a theoretical understanding of the four methods we presented
			and might have looked into how the methods produce different updates on the
			meta-parameter \( \theta \). To complete the comparison, we want to give
			you a short overview over empirical results of these methods on two
			common few-shot benchmarks
			<d-cite bibtex-key="lake_omniglot_2015"></d-cite>
			and Mini-ImageNet
			<d-cite bibtex-key="liu_tools_2019"></d-cite>.

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			In this multi-part series on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) we have studied an optimization-based
			approach to
			solve few-shot learning
			problems, where we expose a learner with only a few samples on a task and hope to somehow converge to a nice
			solution.
			MAML builds up a model of the world from studying other tasks and thereby finding an initialization for
			which only
			a few gradient descent steps are enough to learn a new task. As long as we can differentiate through the
			optimizer we
			use for the tasks (also called the inner optimizer), MAML can be applied to all architectures and learning
			schemes, making it
			a versatile tool for few-shot learning. However, we also studied the computational overhead that comes with
			such a differentiation
			and thus extensions to MAML are needed which bypass the terms of the meta-gradient which are costly to
			obtain. While FOMAML simply drops these terms from the meta-gradient, Reptile abandons the computation of
			a meta-gradient altogether and computes a moving average of optimal task parameters instead. In contrast
			iMAML creates
			a dependency between initial parameters and loss space and therefore allows us to compute the meta-gradient
			without differentiating
			through the inner optimizer.

			<b>Before you leave:</b> After letting your browser compute a bunch of meta-updates, you may want
			to cool it off and take a look at our computationally lightweight but not-to-miss
			<a href="further-reading.html">further reading section</a>. As you will see, MAML has sparked a plethora of
			research on optimization-based meta-learning with many interesting approaches.
