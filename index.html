			If you tried the exercise above, you have undoubtedly received a very high accuracy score.
			Even though you likely have never seen some of the characters,
			you can classify them given only a single example, potentially
			without realizing that what you are able to do off the top of your head would be pretty impressive to an
			average
			deep neural network.

		<p>
			In this article, we give an interactive introduction to
			model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML)<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>, a well-establish method in the area of meta-learning. Meta-learning is
			a research field
			that attempts to equip conventional machine learning architectures with the power to gain meta-knowledge
			about a range of
			tasks to solve problems like the one above on a human level of accuracy.
		</p>

		<h3>Getting Started</h3>
		<p>
			It is well known in the machine learning community that models must be trained with a large number of examples before meaningful predictions can be made for unseen data. 
            However, we do not always have enough data available to
			cater to this need: A sufficient amount of data may be expensive or even
			impossible to acquire.
			Nevertheless, there are good reasons to believe that this is not an inherent issue
			of learning.
			Humans are known to excel at generalizing after seeing only a few
			samples <d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:journals/jmlr/SalakhutdinovTT12"></d-cite>.
			It should, however, also be noted that humans do not learn
			novel concepts "in a vacuum"<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/cogsci/LakeSGT11"></d-cite> but are based on a lot of prior
			knowledge, they might have learned in other (similar) tasks.
			Enabling machine learning methods to achieve the same brings us a step closer to learning on humans' data-
			and energy-efficiency
			level. Consequently, we would require algorithms to do the following two things, already
			successfully implemented in humans:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>(a) Obtaining as much prior knowledge about the world as possible and</li>
			<li>(b) using that to generalize well on only a few samples.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The MAML method we present in this article has prominently emerged from research
			in two fields which each address one of the above requirements. While introducing these fields to you, we
			will
			also equip you with the most important terms and concepts we will need along the rest of the article.
		</p>

		<h4>(a) Obtaining Prior Knowledge</h4>
		<p>
			While clearly, one sample is not enough for a model without prior knowledge,
			we can pretrain models on tasks that we assume to be similar to the target tasks.
			The idea in its core is to derive an inductive bias
			from a set of problem classes to perform better on other, newly encountered, problem-classes.
			This similarity assumption allows the model to collect meta-knowledge
			that is not obtained from a single task but from the distribution of tasks.
			The learning of this meta-knowledge is called "meta-learning".
		</p>

		<h4>(b) Generalization on a Few Samples</h4>
		<p>
			Achieving rapid convergence of machine learning models on a few samples is known as
			"few-shot learning". If you are presented with \(N\) samples and are expected to learn a classification
			problem with \( M \)
			classes, we speak of an \( M \)-way-\(N\)-shot problem.
			The small exercise from the beginning, which we offer either as a \(20\)- or \(5\)-way-1-shot problem, is a
			prominent example of a few-shot learning task, whose symbols are
			taken from
			the <d-cite bibtex-key="lake_omniglot_2015"><i>omniglot</i> dataset</d-cite>.
			It contains 1623 different characters across 50 alphabets, with each character
			being represented by 20 instances, each drawn by a different person. Because of that, the original authors
			of the Omniglot dataset
			described it as a "transpose" of the well-known MNIST dataset <d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/cogsci/LakeSGT11"></d-cite>,
			with MNIST containing only a few classes (the digits 0 to 9) and many instances and Omniglot containing a
			lot of classes but only a few instances for each.
		</p>



		<p>
			Having set the scene, we can now dig into MAML and its
			variants. Continue reading on <a href="meta-learning.html">the next page</a>
			to find out why MAML is called
			"model-agnostic" or go straight to an explanation of <a href="maml.html">MAML</a>.
